## How does this Module Work?

The Giveaway module enables your server to host engaging and automated giveaways. When a giveaway is created, members can enter by clicking an interactive button attached to the giveaway message.

This system is designed with ease-of-use in mind. Members can view the giveaway details and see the number of participants. Server Managers have access to powerful administrative commands to manage ongoing and completed giveaways efficiently.
