## How does this Module Work?
Upon the execution of a Giveaway, Member's will be able to participate by clicking on a button attached to the giveaway. This module is made to be interacted with ease! User's are able to view other participants who have entered within the Givewaway. This module contains many Management Commands to administrate a giveaway.

## How do I configure the Giveaway module?
To set up the Giveaway module, first use the `/config` command to access the configuration panel. From there, youâ€™ll see a "**Select Plugin**" dropdown menu. Click the menu and choose the **Giveaway Module** and click "**Enable**" button. Once enabled, your Giveaway System is fully setup!

<Note>
You must configure the Management under the guild settings options **(ONLY Owners can use this option).**
