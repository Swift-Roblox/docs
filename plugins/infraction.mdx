## What is Infraction?
An **infraction** is a recorded violation of server rules or staff policies. In Swift, infractions help management track disciplinary actions such as warnings, strikes, notices, demotions, and terminations, ensuring a structured and transparent moderation system.

## How do I configure the Infraction module?
To set up the Infraction module, first use the `/config` command to access the configuration panel. From there, youâ€™ll see a "**Select Plugin**" dropdown menu. Click the menu and choose the **Infraction module** and click "**Enable**" button. Once enabled, you will have the option to configure various settings, including the **infraction log channel** where all infractions will be recorded, as well as a **[custom embed](/miscellaneous/variables#infraction-variables)** to personalize the appearance of infraction messages.

<Note>
You must configure the staff role and management under the guild settings options **(ONLY Owners can use this option).**
</Note>

<Warning>
User's must have the Management Role to execute/manage an Infraction
