## How does this work?
Once the member clicks onto the Appeal Button, they will be greated with a Modal / Form. Within this modal, the user will input a few questions relevant and in correspondence to the details of their ban. Their Roblox Details will automatically be collected via our Automatic Verification System. After the user has submitted their appeal, this will be sent to your submittion channel; where a Server Manager can Accept/Deny the appeal. The User will automatically be notified of the result, and unbanned from your ER:LC Private Server if accepted. 
## How do I configure the Promotion module?
To set up the Promotion module, first use the `/config` command to access the configuration panel. From there, youâ€™ll see a "**Select Plugin**" dropdown menu. Click the menu and choose the **Ban Appeal module** and click "**Enable**" button. Once enabled, you will have the option to configure various settings, including the **appeal channel** where your Appeal Button will send, as well the **Submittion Channel**, where the Appeal Submittions will be sent for review.

<Note>
This module does not currently support customizable questions. This will be added in the near future.
