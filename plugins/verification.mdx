## What is Verification?

The **Verification Module** links a user’s Discord account to their Roblox identity.  
This process ensures users are who they say they are, helping staff enforce rules, manage in-game bans, and handle appeals more accurately.

Once verified, a user’s Roblox data will be stored and used across the bot’s systems—such as **Appeals**, **Moderation**, and **Shift Logging**.

## How to Configure Verification

To enable and configure the Verification system:

1. Run the `/config` command to access the Configuration Panel.
2. Open the "**Select Plugin**" dropdown menu.
3. Choose the **Verification Module**.
4. Click "**Enable**" to activate verification in your server.

<Note>
Make sure to also configure the **Verified Role** under Guild Settings so users get a role once they successfully verify.

## How to Verify

Once the module is enabled, members can simply run the `/verify` command in your server.

Upon execution, the bot will respond with an **interactive embed**:

- If the user is **already verified**, the embed will display their connected Roblox account along with an **Unlink** button.
- If the user is **not verified**, the embed will provide a **Verify** button that directs them to [verify.swiftbot.site](https://verify.swiftbot.site).

### Verification Flow:

1. The user clicks the **Verify** button in the embed.
2. They're redirected to [verify.swiftbot.site](https://verify.swiftbot.site).
3. The user will first be prompted to **authenticate with Discord**.
4. Then, they'll log in using their **Roblox account**.
5. Upon successful completion, their account is linked and they’ll be granted the configured **Verified Role** and **Nickname**.

<Warning>
If the user is unable to verify, it is likely because their Roblox account is **underage** and does not meet the requirements to use the OAuth2 verification system.
</Warning>

<Note>
Users must remain in the server and have **DMs enabled** for full functionality and follow-up notifications.
</Note>
