## What is a Promotion?
A promotion is an official record of a Staff Member's upranking. This assists with Staff Management, allowing each promotion to be documented within the respective channel, and recognizing the Staff Member for their hard work. 

## How do I configure the Promotion module?
To set up the Promotion module, first use the `/config` command to access the configuration panel. From there, youâ€™ll see a "**Select Plugin**" dropdown menu. Click the menu and choose the **Promotion module** and click "**Enable**" button. Once enabled, you will have the option to configure various settings, including the **promotion log channel** where all promotions will be recorded, as well as a **[custom embed](/miscellaneous/variables#infraction-variables)** to personalize the appearance of your promotion messages.

<Note>
You must configure the staff role and management under the guild settings options **(ONLY Owners can use this option).**
</Note>

<Warning>
User's must have the Management Role to execute a Promotion
